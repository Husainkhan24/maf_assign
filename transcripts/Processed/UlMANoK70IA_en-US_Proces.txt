Hello, friends! 
On the evening of May 10 
a ceasefire was announced in the India-Pakistan conflict 
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that 
Pakistan's DGMO, 
that is the Director General of Military Operations 
called our country's DGMO at 335 PM 
On this call both sides agree that 
from 5 PM IST 
firing and military action will be stopped at land air sea and everywhere else 
It was to be a ceasefire 
But people found out about this through Donald Trump's social media post 
Trump stated that talks lasted all through the night 
mediated by the US 
after which India and Pakistan 
agreed to a 'full and immediate' ceasefire 
But just a few hours later 
Pakistan began violating the ceasefire 
If the Pakistanis lose 
they come back to strike again 
The reports on what exactly happened aren't clear yet 
But one thing is clear 
It's difficult to trust Pakistan's army and its government 
The Pakistani politics that has supported terrorism on its land for years 
has sponsored terrorism 
to stop its activities all of a sudden 
Can it be truly expected 
Look at this instance 
In the last video I told you that 
the responsibility of the Pahalgam terrorist attack 
was assumed by the Pakistani terror group TRF 
A shadow group of the terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba 
In response to this India launched 
Operation Sindoor 
and attacked nine terrorist sites in Pakistan 
During the press briefing it was revealed that 
these targets were chosen based on credible intelligence input 
so that any civilian infrastructure isn't damaged 
and there's no loss of civilian lives 
Nine terrorist camps were targeted 
and successfully destroyed 
The locations were so selected 
to avoid damage to
civilian infrastructures 
and loss of any civilian lives 
But Pakistan's response to this 
once again proves that 
Pakistan's government and its military 
support terrorism 
And after India's precision strikes 
on terror camps in Pakistan 
and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 
Islamabad retaliated by shelling civilian villages 
along the Line of Control 
Pakistan as a state is a sponsor of terrorism 
Why am I saying this 
Because they ignored all international protocols 
and attacked civilians cowardly 
After Operation Sindoor 
Pakistan launched an unprovoked firing on the LoC 
Not only that they bombed Indian civilian houses with mortars and shells 
Poonch is a city located near the border 
At least 16 people were killed there 
And a total of 59 people were injured 
44 of whom were civilians 
A total of 16 civilians have been killed 
and 59 others have been injured in the attacks 
Poonch resident Harcharan Singh said that 
his friend Rizwan was with his children 
when a shell hit his car 
Both his children a 14-year-old and a 12-year-old 
were killed. 
Look at this photo published in The Independent 
These 12-year-old twins Zain and Zoya 
when bombs were dropped on Poonch 
a bomb fell on their house 
Holding their father's hand 
they were going to a safe place 
when another bomb fell on the street 
Unfortunately they didn't survive 
Their father Rameez Khan was injured 
and is now in the hospital 
The military that attacks innocent civilians knowingly and intentionally 
kills innocent children, 
shouldn't it be called a terrorist state 
Friends this video is especially important for the Pakistani masses 
Around 6-7 of the viewers on this channel are from Pakistan 
And I think it's crucial to put this truth in front of them 
Because their media their government and their military 
will never tell them

You will find the link in the description below 
Or you can scan this QR code 
Let's look at some of the 9 terrorist sites attacked by India in Operation Sindoor 
In Muridke, Markaz Taiba, 
was the headquarters of Hafiz Saeed 
Hafiz Saeed who was designated as a terrorist by the UN in 2008 
In 2012 America had put a 10 million bounty on him 
This was the nerve centre of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba 
The second place that was targeted was Markaz Subhanallah 
It was Masood Azhar's base 
In 2019 he too was put on the list of terrorists by the UN 
This place was the headquarters of his terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad 
The third site was the Syedna Bilal Camp in Muzaffarabad 
The recruits of Lashkar and Jaish were trained there 
And who provided this training 
Pakistan's Special Forces 
The fourth site was the Sawai Nala Camp in Muzaffarabad 
There the terrorists involved in the Pahalgam terror attack were trained 
The remaining five sites were similar 
An initial induction centre for terrorists 
An indoctrination centre 
And even a training camp 
These places helped them prepare to carry out terrorist attacks 
Terrorist attacks in which not only are Indians killed 
but many Pakistanis are killed too 
Have you forgotten the Peshawar School Massacre 
The heart-wrenching terrorist attack from 2014 
where at least 132 innocent children lost their lives 
The latest on that school tragedy in Pakistan 
The death toll from the Taliban's horrifying attack 
topping 140, 
almost all of them young students 
A terrorist organisation in Pakistan the TTP 
had assumed responsibility for this terrorist attack 
TTP stands for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan 
You may wonder about the link between these two news articles 
The link is that if a place becomes a terrorist den 
even their children there would be unsafe 
Look at another link 
This news report was published in the Times of India just a few days ago 
This very TTP 
killed 20 people from the Pakistan Army 
And Baloch insurgents killed two 
A few days before this 
Balochistan Liberation Army or the BLA 
attacked a Pakistani military vehicle in Bolan 
In this IED attack 
8 soldiers of the Pakistani Army were killed 
and 6 were critically injured 
A week before this the BLA carried out another IED attack 
10 Pakistani Army personnel were killed 
It was the Baloch Liberation Army 
that had targeted a convoy of Pakistani officers 
10 Pakistani army personnel 
have been killed in this attack 
Official estimates say that in the last 20 years 
TTP has killed more than 80000 Pakistanis 
You must've heard the saying 
if you sow the seeds of discord you cannot expect peace 
A few days ago Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif 
admitted this while talking to Sky News 
News presenter Yalda Hakim asked 
if he would admit that 
Pakistan has a long history of 
backing supporting training and funding these terrorist organisations 
Would you admit sir 
that Pakistan has had a long history of 
backing and supporting and training and funding 
these terrorist organisations 
To this Khwaja Asif replied that 
they have been doing this dirty work for the past 3 decades ie 30 years 
For America for the West and even for Britain 
Well we have been doing this dirty work 
for the United States for about three decades 
And the West including Britain 
He said that it was a mistake 
and that's why they have had to suffer 
That was a mistake 
and we suffered for that 
In March 2019 former Pakistani Prime Minister 
Imran Khan had admitted to this too 
He said that the Jihadi outfits 
have been around since the time 
of the US-led Afghan war against the Soviets in Afghanistan 
And they've been operating there for decades 
Imran Khan had admitted to the mistakes of the past 
but he has not admitted to the truth today 
He said that Pakistan has now shut down all such Jihadi groups 
That there's no place for them 
Similarly Khawaja Asif admitted to the mistakes of the past 
but he was on denial mode on the current situation 
When the Sky News's anchor mentioned 
that the Pakistani terrorist organisation 
TRF assumed responsibility for the Pahalgam terrorist attack 
and that it's an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba 
You're talking about an offshoot 
of Lashkar-e-Taiba." 
To this he replied that 
Lashkar-e-Taiba does not exist in Pakistan anymore 
That it has gone extinct 
Let me tell you Lashkar-e-Taiba is a name from the past 
It is totally defunct 
It does not exist." 
Pakistan's habit of being in denial 
was quickly unravelled by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor 
A few days ago he was talking to the Al Arabiya Channel 
and he said that Pakistan is a master of denying everything 
Don't forget that Pakistan is a master of denial 
Earlier Pakistan denied their role in the 2611 Mumbai attacks 
But when one of the terrorists was caught alive 
they had to admit to it later on 
Initially Pakistan had denied knowing anything about Osama Bin Laden 
And then Osama was caught 
in a military camp near Pakistan's Army Base 
"Such hypocrisy!" 
This Operation Sindoor was carried out because 
there was a lot of circumstantial evidence 
There were intelligence intercepts 
And India acted based on them 
Otherwise why would have India acted 
All said and done what does India stand to gain from Pakistan 
India is a status quo power 
It wants nothing that Pakistan has 
It is focused on growing its economy 
improving its high technology 
and providing a future for its young people 
It is entirely happy to be left alone by Pakistan 
And it will leave Pakistan alone 
Shashi Tharoor said that these attacks 
were precise and restrained 
We didn't want any loss of civilian life 
No civilian or military sites were attacked 
This attack was carried out at night 
to ensure that there would be no civilians around 
And the locations of the attack 
not only do the Indian authorities 
but also the international intelligence community 
have listed them to be terrorist sites 
Financial Action Task Force aka FATF 
is an organisation that 
keeps an eye on global money laundering and terror financing 
It puts different countries on the Grey List or the Black List 
based on their terrorist connections 
Pakistan has been on their Increased Monitoring Grey List thrice 
The latest was in June 2018 
The FATF made an action plan for Pakistan to improve its standing 
which listed 34 items 
All related to terror financing and money laundering 
Pakistan promised to take action on these 
and in October 2022 
Pakistan was removed from this Grey List 
But what did Pakistan do just after this happened 
Look at this report from 2 months ago 
Intel Lab's geo intelligence researcher 
Damien Symon helped India Today analyse these satellite images 
It reveals that Jaish-e-Mohammad's most widely acknowledged base 
in Bahawalpur, 
has doubled in size compared to 2011-12 
It is now spread across 18 acres 
In late 2022 when Pakistan was removed from the FATF's Grey List 
the construction speed at this site took off around the same time 
India Today's Open Intelligence team found that 
on 16th February 
there was a Jaish-e-Mohammed gathering at the Usman-O-Ali campus 
This place was used for terrorist recruitment and fundraising 
And now look at this report from 5 months ago 
from December 2024 
There is a French magazine called Spectacle du Monde 
Whose editor-in-chief Antoine Colonna 
wrote an article titled 
Jaish-e-Mohammad Troubled Games in Pakistan 
This report stated that 
there are satellite photos on the Planet Labs website 
which show that in Bahawalpur 
there are two Jaish-e-Mohammad dens 
Markaz Subhanallah 
and Usman-o-Ali Masjid. 
These hideouts were for indoctrination and training of the terrorists 
Apart from the satellite imagery 
eyewitness accounts reveal that 
they are run in plain sight 
And one of the complexes 
is only 8 km away from the Pakistan military base 
The report highlighted that in Bahawalpur 
Jaish-e-Mohammad is resurging 
After the 2019 Pulwama attack 
Pakistan announced that 
the administration of the Jaish-e-Mohammad headquarters in Bahawalpur 
would be taken over by the state 
The Bahawalpur Deputy Commissioner Shahzaib Saeed 
told the visiting journalist that 
it was just a normal Madrasa 
with no link to Jaish-e-Mohammad 
But look at this report published in The Print in October 2022 
Two sources told The Print that 
Jaish-e-Mohammad bought 4 acres of land recently 
And they were expanding their Bahawalpur complex 
A local nambardar of the village Zahid Channar 
sold this land to Abdul Rauf 
Abdul Rauf is Masood Azhar's brother 
In 2010 America had declared him a designated terrorist too 
That was because 
he was responsible for the attacks on India in 2008 
This same Abdul Rauf 
was seen in a photo 
leading the funeral prayers for the slain terrorists 
And behind him in the same photo you can see 
Pakistan's military personnel. 
Even the coffins are honoured with Pakistan's national flag 
This shows that these terrorists were being given a state funeral 
Think about what this says about the Pakistani state 
Indian High Commissioner to the UK Vikram Doraiswami 
presented this photo in an interview with the Sky News 
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri presented this photo too 
What more evidence do you need 
The Print got hold of a children's magazine by Jaish-e-Mohammad 
whose title was Muslim Kids 
It showed how 600 children studying at the Madarsa 
were being told to support Jihad 
In November 2022 The Print got such photos and videos 
which show that on the land acquired that year 
Jaish-e-Mohammad had already begun the construction there 
These things make it extremely clear that 
Shashi Tharoor's claims were 100 true 
These are extremely well-known terror bases 
The headquarters of the Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur 
and the headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke 
These are not innocent places 
The locations of India's attacks 
on the Bahawalpur site 
it was a well-known terrorist site 
On 3rd January 2022 
Jaish-e-Mohammad held a public gathering in POK 
In December 2021, 
the terrorist attack on the Shrinagar Police 
they claimed responsibility for that 
and raised funds for future terrorist operations 
We need to ask the Pakistani government 
how much more evidence do they need 
for them to realise that these terrorist organisations are still active 
in their country 
The strangest part is 
how successful Pakistani politics has been in fooling the FATF 
Do one thing 
go and tag their Twitter handle 
Their Twitter handle is FATFNews 
Tag them with the link to this video 
And demand that based on these evidences 
Pakistan should be back on their Grey List 
Here the IMF should be under scrutiny too 
They approved a loan package of 23 billion for Pakistan 
AIMIM leader Owaisi declared Pakistan a threat to humanity 
He called this fund the International Militant Fund 
This is not the International Monetary Fund 
they are handing out International Militant Fund to Pakistan 
He was surprised at the IMF's executive board 
and how America Germany and Japan agreed to this 
There's the USA Germany and Japan 
How are they agreeing to this 
Our land our homes and our soldiers are under attack 
And they are getting a loan of 1 billion 
Till now we've been talking about Jaish-e-Mohammad 
now let's talk about Lashkar-e-Taiba 
A few days ago the Indian Government Agency 
NIA told the Supreme Court that 
in 2021, 
the 2900 kg of heroin seized at Mundra Port 
was worth about 210 billion 
This was part of Lashkar-e-Taiba's narco-trafficking strategy 
Selling drugs to our country's youth 
to destabilise India 
and use the money 
to fund terror activities 
Additional Solicitor General 
Aishwarya Bhati told the court 
to look at what they have done to India by shooting innocent tourists in Pahalgam 
She explained that similar consignments have been 
brought from Afghanistan to India before 
These drugs were stored in warehouses in the Neb Sarai and Alipur areas of Delhi 
And then the money they get by selling these 
was routed to the Lashkar-e-Taiba 
She said that Petitioner Kabir Talwar 
who filed a petition for bail 
was a part of this drug syndicate 
Adani Ports and SEZ Limited 
back then in October 2021 they stated that 
15th November onwards 
at all their terminals 
they would stop handling all container cargoes 
from Pakistan Afghanistan and Iran 
But look at this report from December 2021 on maritimegatewaycom 
It wasn't even a month later that 
they withdrew their decision 
Look at this news from July 2022 merely 7 months later 
Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad 
seized 70 kg of heroin from a container 
This was priced at 350 billion 
Where was it seized from 
From near Mundra Port. 
The ASG has told the court that 
in the 2021 drug-seizure case 
a key witness 
a retired customs official 
was found dead under suspicious conditions 
In an affidavit the NIA had stated that 
the narco-trafficker was in Afghanistan 
With help from Pakistan's ISI and Iranian middlemen 
he sent heroin weighing more than 2900 kilos from Afghanistan to Iran 
and then imported it to India 
This was imported under the guise of talc powder 
Lashkar-e-Taiba was formed in 1986 
during the Islamisation process of Zia ul Haq 
The United Nations Security Council has said that 
this organisation has carried out many terrorist operations 
The December 2001 Indian Parliament attack 
The July 2006 bombings in Mumbai local trains 
And even the 2611 attacks 
they were the ones responsible 
International security expert Ashley Tellis wrote an article 
for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace 
He wrote that from the very beginning 
Pakistan has been
favouring Lashkar. 
Lashkar terrorist David Headley had said that 
in 2008 for the Mumbai attacks 
he coordinated with the Pakistani intelligence officers 
At one point Lashkar-e-Taiba formed a charity wing 
Jamaat-Ud-Dawa. 
But according to the US Australia and the United Nations 
there are no differences between the two wings 
And both were banned 
In March 2019 
Pakistan banned this Jamaat-ud-Dawa too 
Now look at this 2022 Hudson Institute report 
It was Pakistan's only Jihadist organisation 
that aligns with the nationalist-Islamist aims of Pakistan's security establishment 
It's said that to implement its agenda in Balochistan 
the Pakistani government has been relying on Lashkar-e-Taiba's Jamaat-e-Dawa 
It has also been deployed to fight the Islamic State in Pakistan 
Think about this 
Pakistani government is using a terrorist organisation 
to fight perceived threats 
What could be a worse situation for a country 
This is why the Pakistani masses need to wake up 
Because of these things 
Pakistan has become a hell 
Look at the Global Peace Index report of 2024 
There are 163 countries on this list 
Pakistan ranks 140th. 
Living in Pakistan has become so unsafe 
This is evident from many Pakistani reports too 
The Centre for Research and Security Studies 
is an Islamabad-based think tank 
In their report they have stated that 
for Pakistan's security forces 
the year 2024 
has been the deadliest in the last 10 years 
Compared to the previous year 
there was a 40 increase in attacks in Pakistan 
905 incidents, in total, 
out of which 444 were Islamist terrorist attacks 
In which 685 soldiers and police officers were killed 
and 927 civilians too 
For the past few decades 
Pakistanis have been fooled like this 
Some power-hungry politicians 
start conflicts with India for no reason 
other than for some muscle flexing 
and use it as an opportunity to become the dictator of the country 
They don't care about their Constitution 
implementing and repealing it 
no one cares about democracy 
In terms of democracy 
till date, no Pakistani
Prime Minister 
has completed the tenure of 5 years 
They get shot overthrown hanged 
exiled and even imprisoned 
Ex-PM Imran Khan is still in jail 
According to reports he has been tortured 
There are no fair elections 
They have made a mockery out of their country 
These situations make life difficult for the common people 
Do you remember what happened in Karachi in March 2023 
11 people were killed in a stampede 
Including 5 women and 3 children 
The stampede occurred during Ramadan 
in an attempt to get free food 
Around the same time there was another news 
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's
Charsadda, 
flour was being handed out 
There was a stampede 
1 person died
and 8 were injured. 
People are dying when trying to get some free flour 
Think about it 
This reminds me of the French Revolution 
Do you know that before the French Revolution 
in the year 1775 
there were flour wars in France 
Literal wars fought over flour 
Will there be a similar revolution in Pakistan too 
If there is a revolution remember one thing 
This religious fanaticism 
bringing up religion in everything 
it is very important to put an end to this 
As long as there's religion in politics 
those in power will keep fooling you 
To celebrities like Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan I would like to say that 
if they really care about their country 
then they need to focus on making it a better place 
They need to be courageous enough to question their government 
Ask the government 
why is Pakistan becoming a terrorist country 
Ask why are these terrorist organisations 
supported by the Pakistani military
