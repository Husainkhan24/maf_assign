[Music] (Start: 0.05s, Duration: 2.75s) 
What do you make of where India finds (Start: 0.24s, Duration: 5.2s) 
itself after this brief very intense uh (Start: 2.8s, Duration: 4.24s) 
military escalation? The trigger was (Start: 5.44s, Duration: 4.0s) 
obviously the terrible behelgam attack. (Start: 7.04s, Duration: 4.719s) 
India had every right to respond. The (Start: 9.44s, Duration: 4.4s) 
response was operation Synindhur which (Start: 11.759s, Duration: 4.241s) 
was meant to ensure justice to the (Start: 13.84s, Duration: 4.0s) 
victims and of course to ensure that (Start: 16.0s, Duration: 4.0s) 
there are no future attacks. But when (Start: 17.84s, Duration: 4.16s) 
you look at what happened subsequently, (Start: 20.0s, Duration: 4.16s) 
Pakistan's retaliation, (Start: 22.0s, Duration: 4.24s) 
uh, you know, America openly saying they (Start: 24.16s, Duration: 3.64s) 
mediated this (Start: 26.24s, Duration: 5.52s) 
truce, have any of those objectives been (Start: 27.8s, Duration: 6.04s) 
actually achieved? Well, I think if you (Start: 31.76s, Duration: 4.0s) 
look at the initial objectives of the (Start: 33.84s, Duration: 5.52s) 
May 7th strike, it was very clearly not (Start: 35.76s, Duration: 5.76s) 
meant to be seen as the opening salvo in (Start: 39.36s, Duration: 5.12s) 
a protracted war. Trying to settle (Start: 41.52s, Duration: 4.64s) 
operation Synindur was not about trying (Start: 44.48s, Duration: 3.04s) 
to settle any larger issues with (Start: 46.16s, Duration: 4.079s) 
Pakistan. was purely a retaliation for (Start: 47.52s, Duration: 5.359s) 
Pahel. The message is you just cannot (Start: 50.239s, Duration: 4.0s) 
send terrorists across the border to (Start: 52.879s, Duration: 2.961s) 
kill our innocent civilians and go away (Start: 54.239s, Duration: 4.041s) 
with impunity. We will hit you. See (Start: 55.84s, Duration: 5.68s) 
after Uri, yes, you crossed the LOC. (Start: 58.28s, Duration: 5.56s) 
After Pulwama, you crossed the IB, the (Start: 61.52s, Duration: 4.56s) 
international border and hit Balakot. (Start: 63.84s, Duration: 4.08s) 
After this, you went into the heartland (Start: 66.08s, Duration: 4.16s) 
of Punjab. You hit Bahavalpur and (Start: 67.92s, Duration: 4.72s) 
Muritk. But you did so in a very (Start: 70.24s, Duration: 5.04s) 
carefully, calculated, precise manner. (Start: 72.64s, Duration: 5.04s) 
I'm told by experts that they even (Start: 75.28s, Duration: 4.479s) 
targeted individual buildings within the (Start: 77.68s, Duration: 4.32s) 
le complex and the Hisbul and the Jes (Start: 79.759s, Duration: 4.161s) 
Muhammad complex. Right? So it was an (Start: 82.0s, Duration: 4.96s) 
incredibly well done strike that sent (Start: 83.92s, Duration: 5.92s) 
this message. Now if the Pakistanis had (Start: 86.96s, Duration: 4.72s) 
had the brains at that point to let it (Start: 89.84s, Duration: 4.639s) 
be or to have done some token shelling (Start: 91.68s, Duration: 4.799s) 
across the border and called it off I (Start: 94.479s, Duration: 3.28s) 
think that would have been that and (Start: 96.479s, Duration: 2.96s) 
India would never have wanted to take it (Start: 97.759s, Duration: 3.281s) 
farther because India wasn't interested (Start: 99.439s, Duration: 3.601s) 
in a war. Right. What happened (Start: 101.04s, Duration: 4.399s) 
thereafter was the Pakistanis decided (Start: 103.04s, Duration: 4.079s) 
that they were going to double down on (Start: 105.439s, Duration: 3.68s) 
why they had done Pelgam which is (Start: 107.119s, Duration: 3.64s) 
partially also to internationalize (Start: 109.119s, Duration: 4.401s) 
Kashmir get India Pakistan back on the (Start: 110.759s, Duration: 4.921s) 
global agenda get the world concerned (Start: 113.52s, Duration: 5.12s) 
about their uh issues and so on and so (Start: 115.68s, Duration: 4.88s) 
they decided first of all they pleaded (Start: 118.64s, Duration: 3.68s) 
innocence we didn't do this the Indians (Start: 120.56s, Duration: 4.159s) 
are attacking us without cause and then (Start: 122.32s, Duration: 4.32s) 
they started hitting back very hard as (Start: 124.719s, Duration: 4.88s) 
you know punch we lost 22 people's lives (Start: 126.64s, Duration: 5.44s) 
and on top of that we've had 59 9 (Start: 129.599s, Duration: 4.161s) 
hospitalized with grave injuries. So (Start: 132.08s, Duration: 3.6s) 
it's not a small matter. Our civilians (Start: 133.76s, Duration: 4.52s) 
have suffered terribly and across the (Start: 135.68s, Duration: 5.52s) 
entire all the damages to done to cars, (Start: 138.28s, Duration: 5.959s) 
buildings etc. So many places from going (Start: 141.2s, Duration: 4.96s) 
back to sort of Rajori and Jammu and so (Start: 144.239s, Duration: 3.841s) 
on all the way right down to Rajasthan. (Start: 146.16s, Duration: 3.92s) 
Yes. So it's really not been not been (Start: 148.08s, Duration: 4.159s) 
good. Uh India has given back as good as (Start: 150.08s, Duration: 4.96s) 
it got. And as far as I'm concerned um (Start: 152.239s, Duration: 5.521s) 
we won't know the full details until (Start: 155.04s, Duration: 4.8s) 
they emerge gradually from both sides. (Start: 157.76s, Duration: 4.4s) 
But India seems to have also exacted (Start: 159.84s, Duration: 4.479s) 
some pretty significant damage including (Start: 162.16s, Duration: 4.0s) 
yes to some of the most important (Start: 164.319s, Duration: 4.241s) 
Pakistani airfields. Right? So this has (Start: 166.16s, Duration: 4.48s) 
been this has been this has been solid (Start: 168.56s, Duration: 3.84s) 
stuff but that's not part of the core (Start: 170.64s, Duration: 5.2s) 
message. The core message was today of (Start: 172.4s, Duration: 5.28s) 
the terrorists that message has been (Start: 175.84s, Duration: 4.72s) 
delivered. I still hope that now that (Start: 177.68s, Duration: 4.96s) 
we've identified by name three of the (Start: 180.56s, Duration: 4.16s) 
four killers that we will go after them (Start: 182.64s, Duration: 3.519s) 
individually and bring them to justice. (Start: 184.72s, Duration: 3.36s) 
I I want to ask that remains to be done (Start: 186.159s, Duration: 3.681s) 
but otherwise there is no there's no (Start: 188.08s, Duration: 3.2s) 
point in going on just shelling and (Start: 189.84s, Duration: 2.96s) 
killing people. No no no of course let (Start: 191.28s, Duration: 3.2s) 
me unpack uh many of the things you said (Start: 192.8s, Duration: 3.12s) 
one by one. Let's start with operation (Start: 194.48s, Duration: 2.88s) 
Synindhur which you said was to send a (Start: 195.92s, Duration: 3.52s) 
message to the terrorists. Now by India (Start: 197.36s, Duration: 3.84s) 
and their handlers and their handlers (Start: 199.44s, Duration: 4.0s) 
now by the Indians own admission that (Start: 201.2s, Duration: 4.16s) 
the targets were these as you mentioned (Start: 203.44s, Duration: 4.4s) 
the various madras and installations of (Start: 205.36s, Duration: 5.12s) 
the Jes and the lashkar toba um the fact (Start: 207.84s, Duration: 4.56s) 
is that these attacks were carried out (Start: 210.48s, Duration: 4.0s) 
late at night. It it was unlikely that (Start: 212.4s, Duration: 3.6s) 
these were heavily peopleled at the (Start: 214.48s, Duration: 3.759s) 
time. That's exactly why we want (Start: 216.0s, Duration: 3.76s) 
civilians around at that time. Muritki (Start: 218.239s, Duration: 3.601s) 
and Bahavalur are thickly populated (Start: 219.76s, Duration: 4.399s) 
towns. We chose a time when there would (Start: 221.84s, Duration: 3.759s) 
not be civilians on the street. (Start: 224.159s, Duration: 2.961s) 
Civilians of course. But if you look at (Start: 225.599s, Duration: 3.2s) 
it in terms of sending the terrorists a (Start: 227.12s, Duration: 4.32s) 
message uh because when the the details (Start: 228.799s, Duration: 4.321s) 
provided by the army suggested that many (Start: 231.44s, Duration: 3.519s) 
of these were installations which were (Start: 233.12s, Duration: 3.44s) 
used to launch terror attacks, some (Start: 234.959s, Duration: 4.161s) 
going back decades. Yeah. Um, which (Start: 236.56s, Duration: 4.319s) 
raises the question though about the (Start: 239.12s, Duration: 3.52s) 
effectiveness because it's still not (Start: 240.879s, Duration: 4.321s) 
clear whether we actually took out any (Start: 242.64s, Duration: 4.64s) 
terrorists, their leaders and so on and (Start: 245.2s, Duration: 4.239s) 
so forth. Pakistan says some 30 odd (Start: 247.28s, Duration: 3.12s) 
people were killed. They were all (Start: 249.439s, Duration: 2.88s) 
civilians. Even if one were to discount (Start: 250.4s, Duration: 3.68s) 
all of it or or we don't have to take (Start: 252.319s, Duration: 3.441s) 
all of it at face value. There is this (Start: 254.08s, Duration: 2.8s) 
question which has been raised by the (Start: 255.76s, Duration: 2.96s) 
way by several strategic experts as well (Start: 256.88s, Duration: 4.0s) 
that if you're going after this kind of (Start: 258.72s, Duration: 4.4s) 
makeshift infrastructure camps etc which (Start: 260.88s, Duration: 4.56s) 
may have been abandoned or evacuated (Start: 263.12s, Duration: 3.6s) 
anticipating an Indian attack (Start: 265.44s, Duration: 3.68s) 
dismantling the terrorist what is the (Start: 266.72s, Duration: 4.479s) 
effectiveness then you're dismantling (Start: 269.12s, Duration: 3.6s) 
the infrastructure from which the (Start: 271.199s, Duration: 3.121s) 
terrorists have come where the (Start: 272.72s, Duration: 2.96s) 
terrorists are trained where they're (Start: 274.32s, Duration: 3.04s) 
guided where they're instructed armed (Start: 275.68s, Duration: 3.44s) 
equipped financed so hitting that (Start: 277.36s, Duration: 3.36s) 
infrastructure sends a powerful message (Start: 279.12s, Duration: 4.079s) 
in itself it's like saying okay so you (Start: 280.72s, Duration: 4.08s) 
didn't want to kill a whole lot of (Start: 283.199s, Duration: 3.28s) 
people, but you definitely wanted to (Start: 284.8s, Duration: 2.88s) 
destroy the building from which they (Start: 286.479s, Duration: 2.801s) 
work. That's what you've gone and done. (Start: 287.68s, Duration: 3.28s) 
Now, that that I believe we've done (Start: 289.28s, Duration: 3.199s) 
effectively. Secondly, they could turn (Start: 290.96s, Duration: 3.12s) 
around and say we'll just we just create (Start: 292.479s, Duration: 4.481s) 
a a whole new set of buildings and (Start: 294.08s, Duration: 4.24s) 
infrastructure. They'll build a new (Start: 296.96s, Duration: 2.959s) 
building. I'm not suggesting we've (Start: 298.32s, Duration: 4.4s) 
completely eliminated LE or JM. No (Start: 299.919s, Duration: 4.081s) 
question about that. They are still (Start: 302.72s, Duration: 3.68s) 
there. Okay. But the fact is they (Start: 304.0s, Duration: 4.08s) 
haven't killed every civil in India (Start: 306.4s, Duration: 3.12s) 
either. I mean, they've killed 26 (Start: 308.08s, Duration: 6.6s) 
people. We gave them a fitting repost. (Start: 309.52s, Duration: 5.16s)
