Hello, friends! (Start: 0.0s, Duration: 1.115s) 
On the evening of May 10, (Start: 1.115s, Duration: 1.415s) 
a ceasefire was announced
in the India-Pakistan conflict. (Start: 2.53s, Duration: 2.785s) 
Foreign Secretary
Vikram Misri stated that (Start: 7.764s, Duration: 2.638s) 
Pakistan's DGMO, (Start: 10.402s, Duration: 1.437s) 
that is, the Director General
of Military Operations, (Start: 11.839s, Duration: 2.431s) 
called our country's
DGMO at 3:35 PM. (Start: 14.27s, Duration: 4.361s) 
On this call, both
sides agree that (Start: 18.631s, Duration: 2.44s) 
from 5 PM IST, (Start: 21.071s, Duration: 1.586s) 
firing and military action will be stopped
at land, air, sea, and everywhere else. (Start: 22.657s, Duration: 5.052s) 
It was to be a ceasefire. (Start: 27.709s, Duration: 1.672s) 
But people found out about this
through Donald Trump's social media post. (Start: 29.56s, Duration: 5.243s) 
Trump stated that talks
lasted all through the night, (Start: 34.803s, Duration: 2.319s) 
mediated by the US, (Start: 37.122s, Duration: 1.645s) 
after which India and Pakistan (Start: 38.767s, Duration: 2.384s) 
agreed to a 'full and
immediate' ceasefire. (Start: 41.151s, Duration: 2.58s) 
But just a few hours later, (Start: 43.731s, Duration: 1.665s) 
Pakistan began
violating the ceasefire. (Start: 45.396s, Duration: 3.748s) 
"If the Pakistanis lose, (Start: 49.144s, Duration: 1.493s) 
they come back to strike again." (Start: 50.637s, Duration: 1.881s) 
The reports on what exactly
happened aren't clear yet. (Start: 52.518s, Duration: 3.297s) 
But one thing is clear. (Start: 55.815s, Duration: 1.682s) 
It's difficult to trust Pakistan's
army and its government. (Start: 57.497s, Duration: 5.11s) 
The Pakistani politics that has
supported terrorism on its land for years, (Start: 62.607s, Duration: 4.315s) 
has sponsored terrorism, (Start: 66.922s, Duration: 1.482s) 
to stop its activities
all of a sudden; (Start: 68.404s, Duration: 2.371s) 
Can it be truly expected? (Start: 70.775s, Duration: 1.803s) 
Look at this instance. (Start: 72.578s, Duration: 1.334s) 
In the last video,
I told you that (Start: 73.912s, Duration: 1.67s) 
the responsibility of the
Pahalgam terrorist attack (Start: 75.582s, Duration: 2.064s) 
was assumed by the
Pakistani terror group TRF. (Start: 77.646s, Duration: 2.545s) 
A shadow group of the terrorist
organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba. (Start: 80.191s, Duration: 3.867s) 
In response to
this, India launched (Start: 84.058s, Duration: 1.692s) 
Operation Sindoor (Start: 85.75s, Duration: 1.233s) 
and attacked nine
terrorist sites in Pakistan. (Start: 86.983s, Duration: 3.441s) 
During the press briefing,
it was revealed that (Start: 90.424s, Duration: 1.42s) 
these targets were chosen
based on credible intelligence input (Start: 91.844s, Duration: 3.663s) 
so that any civilian
infrastructure isn't damaged (Start: 95.507s, Duration: 2.364s) 
and there's no
loss of civilian lives. (Start: 97.871s, Duration: 2.386s) 
"Nine terrorist
camps were targeted (Start: 100.257s, Duration: 1.865s) 
and successfully destroyed. (Start: 102.122s, Duration: 1.378s) 
The locations were so selected (Start: 103.5s, Duration: 1.897s) 
to avoid damage to
civilian infrastructures (Start: 105.397s, Duration: 2.638s) 
and loss of any civilian lives." (Start: 108.035s, Duration: 2.08s) 
But Pakistan's response to this, (Start: 110.115s, Duration: 2.42s) 
once again proves that (Start: 112.535s, Duration: 1.657s) 
Pakistan's government
and its military (Start: 114.192s, Duration: 2.639s) 
support terrorism. (Start: 116.831s, Duration: 2.305s) 
"And after India's
precision strikes (Start: 119.136s, Duration: 1.936s) 
on terror camps in Pakistan (Start: 121.072s, Duration: 1.401s) 
and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, (Start: 122.473s, Duration: 2.157s) 
Islamabad retaliated by
shelling civilian villages (Start: 124.63s, Duration: 2.547s) 
along the Line of Control." (Start: 127.177s, Duration: 1.501s) 
Pakistan as a state is
a sponsor of terrorism. (Start: 128.977s, Duration: 2.648s) 
Why am I saying this? (Start: 131.625s, Duration: 1.039s) 
Because they ignored
all international protocols (Start: 132.664s, Duration: 3.833s) 
and attacked civilians cowardly. (Start: 136.497s, Duration: 3.012s) 
After Operation Sindoor, (Start: 139.509s, Duration: 1.031s) 
Pakistan launched an
unprovoked firing on the LoC. (Start: 140.54s, Duration: 4.03s) 
Not only that, they bombed Indian
civilian houses with mortars and shells. (Start: 144.57s, Duration: 4.619s) 
Poonch is a city
located near the border. (Start: 149.189s, Duration: 2.277s) 
At least 16 people
were killed there. (Start: 151.466s, Duration: 2.282s) 
And a total of 59
people were injured, (Start: 153.748s, Duration: 1.907s) 
44 of whom were civilians. (Start: 155.655s, Duration: 2.29s) 
"A total of 16 civilians
have been killed (Start: 157.945s, Duration: 3.049s) 
and 59 others have been
injured in the attacks..." (Start: 160.994s, Duration: 3.314s) 
Poonch resident,
Harcharan Singh, said that (Start: 164.308s, Duration: 2.183s) 
his friend Rizwan
was with his children (Start: 166.491s, Duration: 2.3s) 
when a shell hit his car. (Start: 168.791s, Duration: 2.117s) 
Both his children, a
14-year-old and a 12-year-old, (Start: 170.908s, Duration: 3.253s) 
were killed. (Start: 174.161s, Duration: 0.944s) 
Look at this photo
published in The Independent. (Start: 175.105s, Duration: 2.327s) 
These 12-year-old
twins, Zain and Zoya, (Start: 177.432s, Duration: 3.14s) 
when bombs were
dropped on Poonch, (Start: 180.572s, Duration: 1.496s) 
a bomb fell on their house. (Start: 182.068s, Duration: 1.698s) 
Holding their father's hand, (Start: 183.766s, Duration: 1.662s) 
they were going to a safe place (Start: 185.428s, Duration: 2.12s) 
when another bomb
fell on the street. (Start: 187.548s, Duration: 3.33s) 
Unfortunately,
they didn't survive. (Start: 190.878s, Duration: 2.425s) 
Their father, Rameez Khan, was injured (Start: 194.826s, Duration: 1.942s) 
and is now in the hospital. (Start: 196.768s, Duration: 1.539s) 
The military that attacks innocent
civilians knowingly and intentionally, (Start: 198.307s, Duration: 4.308s) 
kills innocent children, (Start: 202.615s, Duration: 1.717s) 
shouldn't it be called
a terrorist state? (Start: 204.332s, Duration: 2.614s) 
Friends, this video is especially
important for the Pakistani masses. (Start: 206.946s, Duration: 3.157s) 
Around 6%-7% of the viewers
on this channel are from Pakistan. (Start: 210.103s, Duration: 3.668s) 
And I think it's crucial to
put this truth in front of them. (Start: 213.771s, Duration: 3.587s) 
Because their media, their
government, and their military (Start: 217.358s, Duration: 3.043s) 
will never tell them. (Start: 220.401s, Duration: 1.418s) 
A small announcement, (Start: 224.865s, Duration: 1.388s) 
spots have opened up for
this month's AI Masterclass. (Start: 226.253s, Duration: 3.095s) 
If you couldn't join it before, (Start: 229.348s, Duration: 1.847s) 
now is the chance,
you can do it today. (Start: 231.195s, Duration: 2.27s) 
In this live workshop, I teach you
how to use more than 25 AI tools (Start: 233.465s, Duration: 3.43s) 
to make your life more
productive and efficient. (Start: 236.895s, Duration: 2.846s) 
You will find the link in
the description below. (Start: 240.0s, Duration: 1.524s) 
Or you can scan this QR code. (Start: 241.524s, Duration: 2.339s) 
Let's look at some of the 9 terrorist sites
attacked by India in Operation Sindoor. (Start: 244.012s, Duration: 5.623s) 
In Muridke, Markaz Taiba, (Start: 250.053s, Duration: 2.067s) 
was the headquarters
of Hafiz Saeed. (Start: 252.12s, Duration: 2.54s) 
Hafiz Saeed, who was designated
as a terrorist by the UN in 2008. (Start: 254.66s, Duration: 6.012s) 
In 2012, America had put
a $10 million bounty on him. (Start: 260.672s, Duration: 4.609s) 
This was the nerve centre of the
terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. (Start: 265.281s, Duration: 4.169s) 
The second place that was
targeted was Markaz Subhanallah. (Start: 271.412s, Duration: 3.233s) 
It was Masood Azhar's base. (Start: 274.645s, Duration: 1.716s) 
In 2019, he too was put on
the list of terrorists by the UN. (Start: 276.361s, Duration: 4.669s) 
This place was the headquarters of his
terrorist organisation, Jaish-e-Mohammad. (Start: 281.03s, Duration: 4.499s) 
The third site was the Syedna
Bilal Camp in Muzaffarabad. (Start: 285.529s, Duration: 3.372s) 
The recruits of Lashkar
and Jaish were trained there. (Start: 288.901s, Duration: 3.558s) 
And who provided this training? (Start: 292.459s, Duration: 1.283s) 
Pakistan's Special Forces. (Start: 293.742s, Duration: 2.393s) 
The fourth site was the Sawai
Nala Camp in Muzaffarabad. (Start: 296.135s, Duration: 2.631s) 
There, the terrorists involved in the
Pahalgam terror attack were trained. (Start: 298.766s, Duration: 2.926s) 
The remaining five
sites were similar. (Start: 301.692s, Duration: 1.642s) 
An initial induction
centre for terrorists. (Start: 303.334s, Duration: 2.009s) 
An indoctrination centre. (Start: 305.343s, Duration: 2.107s) 
And even a training camp. (Start: 307.45s, Duration: 1.798s) 
These places helped them
prepare to carry out terrorist attacks. (Start: 309.248s, Duration: 4.401s) 
Terrorist attacks in which
not only are Indians killed, (Start: 315.68s, Duration: 3.245s) 
but many Pakistanis
are killed too. (Start: 318.925s, Duration: 2.708s) 
Have you forgotten the
Peshawar School Massacre? (Start: 321.633s, Duration: 1.923s) 
The heart-wrenching
terrorist attack from 2014 (Start: 323.556s, Duration: 2.933s) 
where at least 132 innocent
children lost their lives. (Start: 326.489s, Duration: 4.116s) 
"The latest on that
school tragedy in Pakistan. (Start: 330.605s, Duration: 2.501s) 
The death toll from the
Taliban's horrifying attack (Start: 333.106s, Duration: 2.8s) 
topping 140, (Start: 335.906s, Duration: 1.807s) 
almost all of them
young students." (Start: 337.713s, Duration: 1.895s) 
A terrorist organisation
in Pakistan, the TTP, (Start: 339.608s, Duration: 3.543s) 
had assumed responsibility
for this terrorist attack. (Start: 343.151s, Duration: 2.618s) 
TTP stands for
Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. (Start: 345.769s, Duration: 3.082s) 
You may wonder about the link
between these two news articles. (Start: 348.851s, Duration: 2.119s) 
The link is that if a place
becomes a terrorist den, (Start: 351.261s, Duration: 3.254s) 
even their children
there would be unsafe. (Start: 354.515s, Duration: 2.805s) 
Look at another link. (Start: 357.32s, Duration: 1.234s) 
This news report was published in
the Times of India just a few days ago. (Start: 358.554s, Duration: 2.272s) 
This very TTP (Start: 360.826s, Duration: 1.389s) 
killed 20 people from
the Pakistan Army. (Start: 362.215s, Duration: 2.399s) 
And Baloch
insurgents killed two. (Start: 364.614s, Duration: 2.56s) 
A few days before this, (Start: 367.174s, Duration: 1.401s) 
Balochistan Liberation
Army, or the BLA, (Start: 368.575s, Duration: 1.843s) 
attacked a Pakistani
military vehicle in Bolan. (Start: 370.418s, Duration: 3.123s) 
In this IED attack, (Start: 373.541s, Duration: 1.536s) 
8 soldiers of the
Pakistani Army were killed (Start: 375.077s, Duration: 2.278s) 
and 6 were critically injured. (Start: 377.355s, Duration: 1.806s) 
A week before this, the BLA
carried out another IED attack. (Start: 379.161s, Duration: 3.047s) 
10 Pakistani Army
personnel were killed. (Start: 382.208s, Duration: 2.587s) 
"It was the Baloch
Liberation Army (Start: 384.795s, Duration: 1.53s) 
that had targeted a
convoy of Pakistani officers. (Start: 386.325s, Duration: 2.628s) 
10 Pakistani army personnel (Start: 388.953s, Duration: 1.437s) 
have been killed
in this attack." (Start: 390.39s, Duration: 1.216s) 
Official estimates say
that in the last 20 years, (Start: 391.606s, Duration: 2.503s) 
TTP has killed more
than 80,000 Pakistanis. (Start: 394.109s, Duration: 4.145s) 
You must've heard the saying (Start: 398.254s, Duration: 1.428s) 
if you sow the seeds of
discord, you cannot expect peace. (Start: 399.682s, Duration: 2.862s) 
A few days ago, Pakistan's
Defense Minister Khawaja Asif (Start: 402.544s, Duration: 3.17s) 
admitted this while talking to Sky News. (Start: 405.738s, Duration: 3.038s) 
News presenter
Yalda Hakim asked, (Start: 408.776s, Duration: 1.807s) 
if he would admit that (Start: 410.583s, Duration: 2.237s) 
Pakistan has a long history of (Start: 412.82s, Duration: 2.454s) 
backing, supporting, training, and
funding these terrorist organisations. (Start: 415.274s, Duration: 4.587s) 
"Would you admit, sir, (Start: 419.861s, Duration: 1.27s) 
that Pakistan has
had a long history of (Start: 421.131s, Duration: 2.081s) 
backing and supporting
and training and funding (Start: 423.212s, Duration: 3.306s) 
these terrorist organisations?" (Start: 426.518s, Duration: 1.817s) 
To this Khwaja Asif replied that (Start: 428.544s, Duration: 1.799s) 
they have been doing this dirty work
for the past 3 decades, i.e., 30 years. (Start: 430.343s, Duration: 4.758s) 
For America, for the
West, and even for Britain. (Start: 435.101s, Duration: 3.42s) 
"Well, we have been
doing this dirty work (Start: 438.521s, Duration: 2.312s) 
for the United States
for about three decades. (Start: 440.833s, Duration: 2.069s) 
And the West,
including Britain." (Start: 442.902s, Duration: 1.941s) 
He said that it was a mistake (Start: 444.843s, Duration: 1.359s) 
and that's why they
have had to suffer. (Start: 446.202s, Duration: 1.737s) 
"That was a mistake (Start: 447.939s, Duration: 1.473s) 
and we suffered for that." (Start: 449.412s, Duration: 1.115s) 
In March 2019, former
Pakistani Prime Minister (Start: 450.527s, Duration: 2.875s) 
Imran Khan had
admitted to this too. (Start: 453.402s, Duration: 2.258s) 
He said that the Jihadi outfits (Start: 455.66s, Duration: 1.868s) 
have been around since the time (Start: 457.528s, Duration: 1.433s) 
of the US-led Afghan war
against the Soviets in Afghanistan. (Start: 458.961s, Duration: 3.952s) 
And they've been
operating there for decades. (Start: 462.913s, Duration: 2.026s) 
Imran Khan had admitted
to the mistakes of the past, (Start: 464.939s, Duration: 2.05s) 
but he has not admitted
to the truth today. (Start: 466.989s, Duration: 1.994s) 
He said that Pakistan has now
shut down all such Jihadi groups. (Start: 468.983s, Duration: 4.311s) 
That there's no place for them. (Start: 473.294s, Duration: 1.408s) 
Similarly, Khawaja Asif admitted
to the mistakes of the past, (Start: 474.702s, Duration: 2.931s) 
but he was on denial mode
on the current situation. (Start: 477.633s, Duration: 3.159s) 
When the Sky News's
anchor mentioned (Start: 480.792s, Duration: 1.502s) 
that the Pakistani
terrorist organisation (Start: 482.294s, Duration: 1.773s) 
TRF assumed responsibility
for the Pahalgam terrorist attack, (Start: 484.067s, Duration: 3.096s) 
and that it's an offshoot
of Lashkar-e-Taiba. (Start: 487.163s, Duration: 2.078s) 
"You're talking
about an offshoot (Start: 489.241s, Duration: 1.376s) 
of Lashkar-e-Taiba." (Start: 490.617s, Duration: 1.555s) 
To this, he replied that (Start: 492.53s, Duration: 1.147s) 
Lashkar-e-Taiba does not
exist in Pakistan anymore. (Start: 493.677s, Duration: 3.892s) 
That it has gone extinct. (Start: 497.569s, Duration: 1.223s) 
"Let me tell you, Lashkar-e-Taiba
is a name from the past. (Start: 498.792s, Duration: 3.974s) 
It is totally defunct. (Start: 502.766s, Duration: 1.75s) 
It does not exist." (Start: 504.516s, Duration: 1.488s) 
Pakistan's habit
of being in denial, (Start: 506.004s, Duration: 2.579s) 
was quickly unravelled by
Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. (Start: 508.583s, Duration: 2.869s) 
A few days ago, he was
talking to the Al Arabiya Channel (Start: 511.452s, Duration: 2.563s) 
and he said that Pakistan is a
master of denying everything. (Start: 514.015s, Duration: 4.39s) 
"Don't forget that Pakistan
is a master of denial." (Start: 518.405s, Duration: 3.619s) 
Earlier, Pakistan denied their
role in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. (Start: 522.024s, Duration: 4.69s) 
But when one of the
terrorists was caught alive, (Start: 526.714s, Duration: 2.185s) 
they had to
admit to it later on. (Start: 528.899s, Duration: 2.144s) 
Initially, Pakistan had denied knowing
anything about Osama Bin Laden. (Start: 531.043s, Duration: 4.249s) 
And then Osama was caught (Start: 535.292s, Duration: 1.805s) 
in a military camp near
Pakistan's Army Base. (Start: 537.097s, Duration: 3.048s) 
"Such hypocrisy!" (Start: 540.145s, Duration: 1.369s) 
This Operation Sindoor
was carried out because (Start: 541.514s, Duration: 1.745s) 
there was a lot of circumstantial evidence. (Start: 543.283s, Duration: 1.706s) 
There were
intelligence intercepts. (Start: 544.989s, Duration: 1.796s) 
And India acted based on them. (Start: 546.785s, Duration: 2.135s) 
Otherwise, why would
have India acted? (Start: 548.92s, Duration: 1.613s) 
All said and done, what does
India stand to gain from Pakistan? (Start: 550.533s, Duration: 2.557s) 
"India is a status quo power. (Start: 553.09s, Duration: 2.019s) 
It wants nothing
that Pakistan has. (Start: 555.109s, Duration: 2.465s) 
It is focused on
growing its economy, (Start: 557.574s, Duration: 2.065s) 
improving its high technology, (Start: 559.639s, Duration: 1.906s) 
and providing a future
for its young people. (Start: 561.545s, Duration: 2.028s) 
It is entirely happy to
be left alone by Pakistan. (Start: 563.573s, Duration: 3.256s) 
And it will leave
Pakistan alone." (Start: 566.829s, Duration: 1.892s) 
Shashi Tharoor said
that these attacks (Start: 568.721s, Duration: 1.912s) 
were precise and restrained. (Start: 570.633s, Duration: 1.826s) 
We didn't want any
loss of civilian life. (Start: 572.459s, Duration: 2.526s) 
No civilian or military
sites were attacked. (Start: 574.985s, Duration: 3.245s) 
This attack was
carried out at night (Start: 578.23s, Duration: 1.736s) 
to ensure that there would
be no civilians around. (Start: 579.966s, Duration: 2.126s) 
And the locations of the attack, (Start: 582.092s, Duration: 1.114s) 
not only do the
Indian authorities, (Start: 583.206s, Duration: 1.653s) 
but also the international
intelligence community (Start: 584.859s, Duration: 2.519s) 
have listed them
to be terrorist sites. (Start: 587.378s, Duration: 1.896s) 
Financial Action
Task Force, aka FATF, (Start: 589.274s, Duration: 2.801s) 
is an organisation that (Start: 592.075s, Duration: 1.492s) 
keeps an eye on global money
laundering and terror financing. (Start: 593.567s, Duration: 3.873s) 
It puts different countries on
the Grey List or the Black List, (Start: 597.44s, Duration: 3.603s) 
based on their
terrorist connections. (Start: 601.043s, Duration: 2.412s) 
Pakistan has been on their
Increased Monitoring Grey List thrice. (Start: 603.455s, Duration: 4.245s) 
The latest was in June 2018. (Start: 608.029s, Duration: 1.818s) 
The FATF made an action plan
for Pakistan to improve its standing, (Start: 609.847s, Duration: 3.393s) 
which listed 34 items. (Start: 613.24s, Duration: 1.731s) 
All related to terror financing
and money laundering. (Start: 614.971s, Duration: 2.633s) 
Pakistan promised
to take action on these (Start: 617.604s, Duration: 2.429s) 
and in October 2022, (Start: 620.033s, Duration: 1.525s) 
Pakistan was removed
from this Grey List. (Start: 621.558s, Duration: 2.863s) 
But what did Pakistan do
just after this happened? (Start: 624.421s, Duration: 3.318s) 
Look at this report
from 2 months ago. (Start: 627.739s, Duration: 1.717s) 
Intel Lab's geo
intelligence researcher, (Start: 629.605s, Duration: 2.05s) 
Damien Symon helped India
Today analyse these satellite images. (Start: 631.655s, Duration: 4.979s) 
It reveals that Jaish-e-Mohammad's
most widely acknowledged base, (Start: 636.634s, Duration: 4.057s) 
in Bahawalpur, (Start: 640.691s, Duration: 1.387s) 
has doubled in size
compared to 2011-12. (Start: 642.078s, Duration: 4.299s) 
It is now spread
across 18 acres. (Start: 646.377s, Duration: 1.778s) 
In late 2022, when Pakistan was
removed from the FATF's Grey List, (Start: 648.155s, Duration: 4.108s) 
the construction speed at this
site took off around the same time. (Start: 652.263s, Duration: 3.219s) 
India Today's Open
Intelligence team found that (Start: 655.482s, Duration: 2.479s) 
on 16th February, (Start: 657.961s, Duration: 1.022s) 
there was a Jaish-e-Mohammed
gathering at the Usman-O-Ali campus. (Start: 658.983s, Duration: 3.391s) 
This place was used for terrorist
recruitment and fundraising. (Start: 662.762s, Duration: 4.091s) 
And now, look at this
report from 5 months ago, (Start: 666.853s, Duration: 2.351s) 
from December 2024. (Start: 669.204s, Duration: 1.905s) 
There is a French magazine
called Spectacle du Monde. (Start: 671.109s, Duration: 2.518s) 
Whose editor-in-chief
Antoine Colonna (Start: 673.627s, Duration: 2.591s) 
wrote an article titled, (Start: 676.218s, Duration: 1.603s) 
Jaish-e-Mohammad,
Troubled Games in Pakistan. (Start: 677.821s, Duration: 2.571s) 
This report stated that (Start: 680.392s, Duration: 1.415s) 
there are satellite photos
on the Planet Labs website, (Start: 681.807s, Duration: 2.673s) 
which show that in Bahawalpur, (Start: 684.48s, Duration: 1.991s) 
there are two
Jaish-e-Mohammad dens, (Start: 686.471s, Duration: 1.893s) 
Markaz Subhanallah (Start: 688.364s, Duration: 1.371s) 
and Usman-o-Ali Masjid. (Start: 689.735s, Duration: 2.09s) 
These hideouts were for indoctrination
and training of the terrorists. (Start: 691.825s, Duration: 3.081s) 
Apart from the
satellite imagery, (Start: 694.906s, Duration: 1.364s) 
eyewitness accounts reveal that (Start: 696.27s, Duration: 1.589s) 
they are run in plain sight. (Start: 697.859s, Duration: 1.546s) 
And one of the complexes (Start: 699.405s, Duration: 1.259s) 
is only 8 km away from
the Pakistan military base. (Start: 700.664s, Duration: 3.336s) 
The report highlighted
that in Bahawalpur, (Start: 704.0s, Duration: 2.068s) 
Jaish-e-Mohammad is resurging. (Start: 706.068s, Duration: 2.617s) 
After the 2019 Pulwama attack, (Start: 708.685s, Duration: 1.727s) 
Pakistan announced that (Start: 710.412s, Duration: 1.439s) 
the administration of the Jaish-e-Mohammad
headquarters in Bahawalpur (Start: 711.851s, Duration: 3.338s) 
would be taken
over by the state. (Start: 715.189s, Duration: 2.427s) 
The Bahawalpur Deputy
Commissioner Shahzaib Saeed (Start: 717.795s, Duration: 2.296s) 
told the visiting
journalist that (Start: 720.091s, Duration: 1.871s) 
it was just a normal Madrasa, (Start: 721.962s, Duration: 1.459s) 
with no link to
Jaish-e-Mohammad. (Start: 723.421s, Duration: 2.443s) 
But look at this report published
in The Print in October 2022. (Start: 725.864s, Duration: 2.933s) 
Two sources told The Print that (Start: 728.976s, Duration: 1.877s) 
Jaish-e-Mohammad bought
4 acres of land recently. (Start: 730.853s, Duration: 3.262s) 
And they were expanding
their Bahawalpur complex. (Start: 734.115s, Duration: 2.958s) 
A local nambardar of the
village, Zahid Channar, (Start: 737.073s, Duration: 2.677s) 
sold this land to Abdul Rauf. (Start: 739.75s, Duration: 2.307s) 
Abdul Rauf is Masood
Azhar's brother. (Start: 742.057s, Duration: 2.69s) 
In 2010, America had declared
him a designated terrorist too. (Start: 744.747s, Duration: 3.698s) 
That was because (Start: 748.445s, Duration: 1.642s) 
he was responsible for
the attacks on India in 2008. (Start: 750.087s, Duration: 3.343s) 
This same Abdul Rauf (Start: 754.445s, Duration: 1.309s) 
was seen in a photo (Start: 755.754s, Duration: 1.312s) 
leading the funeral prayers
for the slain terrorists. (Start: 757.066s, Duration: 4.142s) 
And behind him, in the
same photo, you can see (Start: 761.208s, Duration: 2.267s) 
Pakistan's military personnel. (Start: 763.475s, Duration: 2.554s) 
Even the coffins are honoured
with Pakistan's national flag. (Start: 766.029s, Duration: 2.625s) 
This shows that these terrorists
were being given a state funeral. (Start: 768.654s, Duration: 3.561s) 
Think about what this says
about the Pakistani state. (Start: 772.215s, Duration: 3.207s) 
Indian High Commissioner
to the UK, Vikram Doraiswami, (Start: 775.422s, Duration: 2.68s) 
presented this photo in an
interview with the Sky News. (Start: 778.102s, Duration: 2.604s) 
Foreign Secretary, Vikram
Misri presented this photo too. (Start: 781.094s, Duration: 2.679s) 
What more evidence do you need? (Start: 783.773s, Duration: 2.158s) 
The Print got hold of a children's
magazine by Jaish-e-Mohammad, (Start: 785.931s, Duration: 2.908s) 
whose title was [Muslim Kids]. (Start: 788.839s, Duration: 1.923s) 
It showed how 600 children
studying at the Madarsa (Start: 791.061s, Duration: 2.901s) 
were being told
to support Jihad. (Start: 793.962s, Duration: 3.385s) 
In November 2022, The Print
got such photos and videos (Start: 797.347s, Duration: 3.385s) 
which show that on the
land acquired that year, (Start: 800.732s, Duration: 2.511s) 
Jaish-e-Mohammad had already
begun the construction there. (Start: 803.243s, Duration: 2.892s) 
These things make
it extremely clear that (Start: 806.204s, Duration: 1.53s) 
Shashi Tharoor's
claims were 100% true. (Start: 807.734s, Duration: 3.732s) 
"These are extremely
well-known terror bases. (Start: 811.466s, Duration: 3.981s) 
The headquarters of the
Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur (Start: 815.447s, Duration: 3.14s) 
and the headquarters of the
Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke. (Start: 818.587s, Duration: 4.436s) 
These are not innocent places." (Start: 823.023s, Duration: 2.448s) 
The locations
of India's attacks, (Start: 825.471s, Duration: 1.557s) 
on the Bahawalpur site, (Start: 827.028s, Duration: 1.154s) 
it was a well-known
terrorist site. (Start: 828.182s, Duration: 1.729s) 
On 3rd January 2022, (Start: 829.911s, Duration: 1.661s) 
Jaish-e-Mohammad held
a public gathering in POK. (Start: 831.572s, Duration: 2.862s) 
In December 2021, (Start: 834.434s, Duration: 1.533s) 
the terrorist attack on
the Shrinagar Police, (Start: 835.967s, Duration: 2.286s) 
they claimed
responsibility for that (Start: 838.253s, Duration: 2.311s) 
and raised funds for
future terrorist operations. (Start: 840.564s, Duration: 3.341s) 
We need to ask the
Pakistani government, (Start: 843.905s, Duration: 3.068s) 
how much more
evidence do they need (Start: 846.973s, Duration: 2.006s) 
for them to realise that these
terrorist organisations are still active (Start: 848.979s, Duration: 2.97s) 
in their country? (Start: 851.949s, Duration: 1.35s) 
The strangest part is (Start: 853.299s, Duration: 0.965s) 
how successful Pakistani politics
has been in fooling the FATF. (Start: 854.264s, Duration: 4.486s) 
Do one thing, (Start: 858.75s, Duration: 1.048s) 
go and tag their Twitter handle. (Start: 859.798s, Duration: 3.163s) 
Their Twitter
handle is FATFNews. (Start: 862.961s, Duration: 2.203s) 
Tag them with the
link to this video. (Start: 865.164s, Duration: 3.71s) 
And demand that based
on these evidences, (Start: 868.874s, Duration: 2.502s) 
Pakistan should be
back on their Grey List. (Start: 871.376s, Duration: 4.252s) 
Here, the IMF should
be under scrutiny too. (Start: 875.628s, Duration: 2.063s) 
They approved a loan package
of $2.3 billion for Pakistan. (Start: 877.691s, Duration: 4.87s) 
AIMIM leader, Owaisi, declared
Pakistan a threat to humanity. (Start: 882.8s, Duration: 4.703s) 
He called this fund the
International Militant Fund. (Start: 887.503s, Duration: 3.528s) 
"This is not the
International Monetary Fund, (Start: 891.031s, Duration: 1.847s) 
they are handing out International
Militant Fund to Pakistan." (Start: 892.878s, Duration: 3.068s) 
He was surprised at
the IMF's executive board (Start: 895.946s, Duration: 2.877s) 
and how America, Germany,
and Japan agreed to this. (Start: 898.823s, Duration: 3.551s) 
"There's the USA,
Germany, and Japan. (Start: 902.374s, Duration: 2.733s) 
How are they agreeing to this? (Start: 905.107s, Duration: 1.725s) 
Our land, our homes, and
our soldiers are under attack. (Start: 906.832s, Duration: 4.132s) 
And they are getting
a loan of $1 billion." (Start: 910.964s, Duration: 3.111s) 
Till now, we've been talking
about Jaish-e-Mohammad, (Start: 914.075s, Duration: 2.096s) 
now, let's talk about
Lashkar-e-Taiba. (Start: 916.171s, Duration: 2.161s) 
A few days ago, the
Indian Government Agency, (Start: 918.332s, Duration: 1.847s) 
NIA told the Supreme Court that (Start: 920.179s, Duration: 1.736s) 
in 2021, (Start: 921.915s, Duration: 1.355s) 
the 2,900 kg of heroin
seized at Mundra Port, (Start: 923.27s, Duration: 5.066s) 
was worth about ₹210 billion. (Start: 928.336s, Duration: 2.875s) 
This was part of Lashkar-e-Taiba's
narco-trafficking strategy. (Start: 931.211s, Duration: 3.656s) 
Selling drugs to
our country's youth (Start: 934.867s, Duration: 1.853s) 
to destabilise India (Start: 936.72s, Duration: 1.81s) 
and use the money (Start: 938.53s, Duration: 1.237s) 
to fund terror activities. (Start: 939.767s, Duration: 2.143s) 
Additional Solicitor General (Start: 942.209s, Duration: 1.297s) 
Aishwarya Bhati told the court, (Start: 943.506s, Duration: 2.104s) 
to look at what they have done to India
by shooting innocent tourists in Pahalgam. (Start: 945.61s, Duration: 5.238s) 
She explained that similar
consignments have been (Start: 950.848s, Duration: 2.268s) 
brought from Afghanistan to India before. (Start: 953.14s, Duration: 2.267s) 
These drugs were stored in warehouses
in the Neb Sarai and Alipur areas of Delhi. (Start: 955.706s, Duration: 3.958s) 
And then the money
they get by selling these (Start: 959.664s, Duration: 2.147s) 
was routed to the
Lashkar-e-Taiba. (Start: 961.811s, Duration: 2.252s) 
She said that
Petitioner Kabir Talwar, (Start: 964.063s, Duration: 2.201s) 
who filed a petition for bail, (Start: 966.264s, Duration: 2.443s) 
was a part of this
drug syndicate. (Start: 968.707s, Duration: 2.871s) 
Adani Ports and SEZ Limited (Start: 971.578s, Duration: 2.31s) 
back then, in October
2021, they stated that (Start: 973.888s, Duration: 2.496s) 
15th November onwards, (Start: 976.384s, Duration: 1.524s) 
at all their terminals, (Start: 977.908s, Duration: 1.399s) 
they would stop handling
all container cargoes (Start: 979.307s, Duration: 2.44s) 
from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. (Start: 981.771s, Duration: 3.037s) 
But look at this report from December
2021 on maritimegateway.com. (Start: 984.808s, Duration: 3.901s) 
It wasn't even a
month later that (Start: 988.709s, Duration: 2.39s) 
they withdrew their decision. (Start: 991.099s, Duration: 3.076s) 
Look at this news from July
2022, merely 7 months later. (Start: 995.638s, Duration: 3.053s) 
Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (Start: 998.691s, Duration: 1.712s) 
seized 70 kg of
heroin from a container. (Start: 1000.403s, Duration: 2.896s) 
This was priced
at ₹3.50 billion. (Start: 1003.299s, Duration: 2.265s) 
Where was it seized from? (Start: 1005.564s, Duration: 1.478s) 
From near Mundra Port. (Start: 1007.042s, Duration: 1.879s) 
The ASG has told the court that (Start: 1008.921s, Duration: 1.528s) 
in the 2021 drug-seizure case, (Start: 1010.449s, Duration: 1.962s) 
a key witness, (Start: 1012.411s, Duration: 1.542s) 
a retired customs official, (Start: 1013.953s, Duration: 1.891s) 
was found dead under
suspicious conditions. (Start: 1015.844s, Duration: 2.257s) 
In an affidavit, the
NIA had stated that (Start: 1018.101s, Duration: 1.565s) 
the narco-trafficker
was in Afghanistan. (Start: 1019.666s, Duration: 2.646s) 
With help from Pakistan's
ISI and Iranian middlemen, (Start: 1022.312s, Duration: 3.53s) 
he sent heroin weighing more than
2,900 kilos from Afghanistan to Iran (Start: 1025.842s, Duration: 4.631s) 
and then imported it to India. (Start: 1030.473s, Duration: 1.746s) 
This was imported under
the guise of talc powder. (Start: 1032.219s, Duration: 3.027s) 
Lashkar-e-Taiba
was formed in 1986, (Start: 1035.246s, Duration: 2.794s) 
during the Islamisation
process of Zia ul Haq. (Start: 1038.04s, Duration: 3.899s) 
The United Nations
Security Council has said that (Start: 1041.939s, Duration: 2.231s) 
this organisation has carried
out many terrorist operations. (Start: 1044.17s, Duration: 3.438s) 
The December 2001
Indian Parliament attack. (Start: 1047.608s, Duration: 2.614s) 
The July 2006 bombings
in Mumbai local trains. (Start: 1050.222s, Duration: 2.96s) 
And even the 26/11 attacks, (Start: 1053.182s, Duration: 1.642s) 
they were the ones responsible. (Start: 1054.824s, Duration: 1.532s) 
International security expert
Ashley Tellis wrote an article (Start: 1056.356s, Duration: 3.833s) 
for the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace. (Start: 1060.189s, Duration: 2.169s) 
He wrote that from
the very beginning, (Start: 1062.358s, Duration: 2.046s) 
Pakistan has been
favouring Lashkar. (Start: 1064.404s, Duration: 2.069s) 
Lashkar terrorist David
Headley had said that (Start: 1066.473s, Duration: 2.324s) 
in 2008, for the Mumbai attacks, (Start: 1068.797s, Duration: 2.502s) 
he coordinated with the
Pakistani intelligence officers. (Start: 1071.299s, Duration: 3.551s) 
At one point, Lashkar-e-Taiba
formed a charity wing, (Start: 1075.358s, Duration: 3.222s) 
Jamaat-Ud-Dawa. (Start: 1078.58s, Duration: 1.402s) 
But according to the US,
Australia, and the United Nations, (Start: 1080.191s, Duration: 2.62s) 
there are no differences
between the two wings. (Start: 1082.811s, Duration: 2.052s) 
And both were banned. (Start: 1084.863s, Duration: 2.194s) 
In March 2019, (Start: 1087.775s, Duration: 1.355s) 
Pakistan banned this
Jamaat-ud-Dawa too. (Start: 1089.13s, Duration: 2.651s) 
Now, look at this 2022
Hudson Institute report. (Start: 1091.781s, Duration: 3.577s) 
It was Pakistan's only
Jihadist organisation (Start: 1095.358s, Duration: 2.934s) 
that aligns with the nationalist-Islamist
aims of Pakistan's security establishment. (Start: 1098.292s, Duration: 5.24s) 
It's said that to implement
its agenda in Balochistan, (Start: 1103.831s, Duration: 3.396s) 
the Pakistani government has been
relying on Lashkar-e-Taiba's Jamaat-e-Dawa. (Start: 1107.227s, Duration: 5.093s) 
It has also been deployed to
fight the Islamic State in Pakistan. (Start: 1112.32s, Duration: 3.709s) 
Think about this, (Start: 1116.238s, Duration: 0.983s) 
Pakistani government is
using a terrorist organisation (Start: 1117.221s, Duration: 4.073s) 
to fight perceived threats. (Start: 1121.294s, Duration: 1.9s) 
What could be a worse
situation for a country? (Start: 1123.194s, Duration: 3.493s) 
This is why the Pakistani
masses need to wake up. (Start: 1126.956s, Duration: 3.523s) 
Because of these things, (Start: 1130.479s, Duration: 1.631s) 
Pakistan has become a hell. (Start: 1132.11s, Duration: 2.057s) 
Look at the Global Peace
Index report of 2024. (Start: 1134.406s, Duration: 2.877s) 
There are 163
countries on this list. (Start: 1137.283s, Duration: 2.034s) 
Pakistan ranks 140th. (Start: 1139.317s, Duration: 2.983s) 
Living in Pakistan
