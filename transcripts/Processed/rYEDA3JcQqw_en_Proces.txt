 
There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch 
It's bringing me out the dark 
Finally I can see you crystal clear 
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare 
See how I'll leave with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do 
There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hands 
And you played it to the beat 
Baby I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one on you 
Now I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair 
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared 
The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love 
They leave me breathless 
 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hands 
And you played it to the beat 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it with a beating 
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold 
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sow 
We could've had it all 
We could've had it all 
It all it all it all 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hands 
And you played it to the beat 
Could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hands 
But you played it you played it you played it 
You played it to the beat
