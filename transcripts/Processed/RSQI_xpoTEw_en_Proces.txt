None 
What do you make of where India finds 
 
military escalation The trigger was 
obviously the terrible behelgam attack 
India had every right to respond The 
response was operation Synindhur which 
was meant to ensure justice to the 
victims and of course to ensure that 
there are no future attacks But when 
you look at what happened subsequently 
 
uh you know America openly saying they 
mediated this 
truce have any of those objectives been 
actually achieved Well I think if you 
look at the initial objectives of the 
May 7th strike it was very clearly not 
meant to be seen as the opening salvo in 
a protracted war Trying to settle 
operation Synindur was not about trying 
to settle any larger issues with 
Pakistan was purely a retaliation for 
Pahel The message is you just cannot 
send terrorists across the border to 
kill our innocent civilians and go away 
with impunity We will hit you See 
after Uri yes you crossed the LOC 
After Pulwama you crossed the IB the 
international border and hit Balakot 
After this you went into the heartland 
 
Muritk But you did so in a very 
carefully calculated precise manner 
I'm told by experts that they even 
targeted individual buildings within the 
le complex and the Hisbul and the Jes 
Muhammad complex Right So it was an 
incredibly well done strike that sent 
this message Now if the Pakistanis had 
had the brains at that point to let it 
 
across the border and called it off I 
think that would have been that and 
India would never have wanted to take it 
farther because India wasn't interested 
in a war Right What happened 
thereafter was the Pakistanis decided 
that they were going to double down on 
why they had done Pelgam which is 
partially also to internationalize 
Kashmir get India Pakistan back on the 
global agenda get the world concerned 
about their uh issues and so on and so 
they decided first of all they pleaded 
innocence we didn't do this the Indians 
are attacking us without cause and then 
they started hitting back very hard as 
you know punch we lost 22 people's lives 
and on top of that we've had 59 9 
hospitalized with grave injuries So 
it's not a small matter Our civilians 
have suffered terribly and across the 
 
buildings etc So many places from going 
back to sort of Rajori and Jammu and so 
on all the way right down to Rajasthan 
Yes So it's really not been not been 
good Uh India has given back as good as 
it got And as far as I'm concerned um 
we won't know the full details until 
they emerge gradually from both sides 
But India seems to have also exacted 
 
yes to some of the most important 
Pakistani airfields Right So this has 
been this has been this has been solid 
stuff but that's not part of the core 
message The core message was today of 
the terrorists that message has been 
delivered I still hope that now that 
we've identified by name three of the 
four killers that we will go after them 
individually and bring them to justice 
I I want to ask that remains to be done 
but otherwise there is no there's no 
point in going on just shelling and 
killing people No no no of course let 
me unpack uh many of the things you said 
one by one Let's start with operation 
Synindhur which you said was to send a 
message to the terrorists Now by India 
and their handlers and their handlers 
now by the Indians own admission that 
the targets were these as you mentioned 
the various madras and installations of 
the Jes and the lashkar toba um the fact 
is that these attacks were carried out 
late at night It it was unlikely that 
these were heavily peopleled at the 
time That's exactly why we want 
civilians around at that time Muritki 
and Bahavalur are thickly populated 
towns We chose a time when there would 
not be civilians on the street 
Civilians of course But if you look at 
it in terms of sending the terrorists a 
message uh because when the the details 
provided by the army suggested that many 
of these were installations which were 
used to launch terror attacks some 
going back decades Yeah Um which 
raises the question though about the 
effectiveness because it's still not 
clear whether we actually took out any 
terrorists their leaders and so on and 
so forth Pakistan says some 30 odd 
people were killed They were all 
civilians Even if one were to discount 
all of it or or we don't have to take 
all of it at face value There is this 
question which has been raised by the 
way by several strategic experts as well 
that if you're going after this kind of 
makeshift infrastructure camps etc which 
may have been abandoned or evacuated 
anticipating an Indian attack 
dismantling the terrorist what is the 
effectiveness then you're dismantling 
the infrastructure from which the 
terrorists have come where the 
terrorists are trained where they're 
guided where they're instructed armed 
equipped financed so hitting that 
infrastructure sends a powerful message 
 
didn't want to kill a whole lot of 
people but you definitely wanted to 
destroy the building from which they 
work That's what you've gone and done 
Now that that I believe we've done 
effectively Secondly they could turn 
around and say we'll just we just create 
a a whole new set of buildings and 
infrastructure They'll build a new 
 
completely eliminated LE or JM No 
question about that They are still 
there Okay But the fact is they 
haven't killed every civil in India 
either I mean they've killed 26 
people We gave them a fitting repost
