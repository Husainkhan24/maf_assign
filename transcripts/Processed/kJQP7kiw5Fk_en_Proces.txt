I saw that the look in your eyes was calling me 
Show me the path that I will take 
Oh! 
You you're the magnet and I'm the metal 
I am getting closer and making a plan 
Simply thinking about it makes my heart race 
Oh, yeah! 
Now I'm already liking it more than usual 
All my senses are asking for more 
We cannot do this in a rush 
Slowly 
I want to breathe in your neck slowly 
Let me murmur things in your ear 
So you can remember when you're not with me 
Slowly 
I want to undress you in kisses slowly 
Sign the walls of your labyrinth 
And of your body I want to create a manuscript 
(Up, up, up; up, up) 
I wanna see your hair dance I want to be your rhythm Woo yeah 
Want you to show my mouth Woo yeah 
Your favorite places 
(Favorite, favorite, baby) 
Let me trespass your danger zones Yeah woo yeah 
Until I make you scream Woo yeah 
And you forget your last name
 (Rrr; DY) 
If I ask for a kiss come give it to me I know you're thinking about it Yeah 
I've been trying to do it for a while Yeah Babe this is giving and giving it to you 
You know that with me your heart goes bam bam 
You know that from me babe is looking for a bam bam 
Come try my mouth and see if you like its taste Eh-eh yo 
I wanna I wanna I want to see how much love fits in you 
I'm not in a rush I want to experience this trip 
Let's start slowly then savagely 
Step by step soft then softly 
We come up against each other little by little 
When you kiss me with that skill 
I see that you are malice with delicacy 
Step by step soft then softly 
We come up against each other little by little Oh oh 
And it's just that your beauty is a puzzle No no 
But to finish it here I have the missing piece
